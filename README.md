# TIC-TAC-TOE-game
Tic Tac Toe (X-O) is a classic 3x3 grid game played by two players taking turns:  Player 1 places X.  Player 2 places O.  The winner is the first player to align three of their marks (X or O) in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If the board is filled and no one wins, the result is a draw.
